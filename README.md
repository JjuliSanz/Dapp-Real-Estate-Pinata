# Real State IPFS Listing App

The Real Estate Listing App allows users to view and search available properties for sale or rent. Listing data, including descriptions, images, and property details, is stored using IPFS and Pinata. This approach provides benefits such as censorship resistance, data immutability, and easy access to information anytime, anywhere. In summary, this project combines a real estate listing application with decentralized technologies like IPFS and Pinata to deliver a secure and reliable database, ensuring the availability and integrity of real estate listing data. This page unfortunately needs a CORS extension to works ;(
